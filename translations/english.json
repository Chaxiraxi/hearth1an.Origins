		"RECORDER_POD_1": "ESCALL: It seems like we had an unsuccessful docking. Is everyone okay?",
		"RECORDER_POD_2": "DIN: Yes, I'm fine. Where are we?",
		"RECORDER_POD_3": "SECCA: I bumped my head a little, but overall, I'll survive. Escall... are you wounded?!",
		"RECORDER_POD_4": "ESCALL: I'm afraid so. I got a piece of glass in my chest during the rough landing.",
		"RECORDER_POD_5": "DIN: Oh no! We need to assess the surroundings and call for help quickly!",
		"RECORDER_POD_6": "SECCA: Din, go search for help. I'll catch up with you soon. I'll set up a distress signal transmitter. Escall, hang in there!",
		"RECORDER_POD_7": "ESCALL: It seems like I'm losing some blood. The important thing is not to remove the shard...",

		"RECORDER_NODE_1": "SECCA: It seems like we've stumbled into a trap. It appears to be a giant plant that manipulates space at will.",
		"RECORDER_NODE_2": "DIN: That's right. No matter where we go, it always brings us back to the starting point. The only way out is to investigate the node covered in the red substance.",
		"RECORDER_NODE_3": "SECCA: The substance doesn't look harmless. It's almost like magma, but it's probably not the same material. What if we somehow disrupt the integrity of the membrane?",
		"RECORDER_NODE_4": "DIN: I've already tried that. Wood, fabric â€” everything instantly ignites.",
		"RECORDER_NODE_5": "SECCA: What if we try <![CDATA[<b>something bigger</b>]]>? We can <![CDATA[<b>eject</b>]]> the door from the escape pod! Its alloy should be able to withstand even atmospheric entry!",
		"RECORDER_NODE_6": "DIN: You're right, that could work. But it is too far away from the membrane. How do we give it enough acceleration to simulate an ejection acceleration?",
		"RECORDER_NODE_7": "ESCALL: My friends, I'm afraid you'll have to continue without me...",
		"RECORDER_NODE_8": "SECCA: The bleeding is getting worse! Escall, can you hear me? Don't give up, hold on!",
		"RECORDER_NODE_9": "ESCALL: I have made up my mind. We have no other options. I will use my remaining oxygen supply to push the door and simulate an <![CDATA[<b>ejection</b>]]>. After all, I am almost dead anyway, and waiting for help is in vain. We are nomai we must not stop.",
		"RECORDER_NODE_10": "SECCA: But you will die! We can't take such a risk, Escall!",
		"RECORDER_NODE_11": "ESCALL: The decision is made. Din, let's proceed!",
		"RECORDER_NODE_12": "...",

		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_1": "DIN: What is this place? A cave? Everything here is so... different and unlike anything else!",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_2": "SECCA: I agree. I suggest we name the place where our rescue capsule landed <![CDATA[<color=orange>Big Blackthorn.</color>]]> It's clear that this is an aggressive environment.",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_3": "DIN: Exactly, but this flora around us doesn't belong to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Big Blackthorn.</color>]]>. There's a possibility that this flora simply turned out to be more aggressive, and now fungi and spores are developing inside the aggressor.",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_4": "SECCA: Yes. It's good that there's at least oxygen here. By the way, did you also hear a voice?",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_5": "DIN: I thought I was imagining it. I could barely hear it. It was asking to be found. Do you think we can trust it?",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_6": "SECCA: Look around, DIN, what else can we do? We can't stay in this cave forever, even though it's beautiful here. He says that to strengthen the connection with him, we need to consume food.",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_7": "DIN: It seems we have few options indeed. Sigh... fine, let's have a bite. We just need to figure out how to start a fire.",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_8": "SECCA: Hypothesis: we could borrow fire from those ghostly creatures flying around the cave. They don't seem aggressive.",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_9": "DIN: Yes, perhaps. I'll gather everything for the fire, and you try to obtain the fire. You'll need a <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>ceremonial vase</color>]]> to carry it to the fire. Due to the high humidity, you'll have to do it quickly.",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_10": "SECCA: Remind me, where did you leave <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>the ceremonial vase</color>]]>?",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_11": "DIN: I'm still not familiar with this place myself... I left it at <![CDATA[<color=orange>Escall's tomb</color>]]>, in the large stone with holes, to the left of the cave entrance.",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_12": "SECCA: Alright, I'll bring it right away. <![CDATA[<b>Here's the plan:</b>]]> I bring the fire, we eat , and we get back from this cave as the voice said.",
		"RECORDER_CAMPFIRE_13": "DIN: Agreed. I believe the enterance is an exit. Don't forget to put the vase back.",

		"RECORDER_GRAVE_1": "SECCA: We will miss Escall dearly.",
		"RECORDER_GRAVE_2": "DIN: He was a true explorer, a true leader of his clan. I hope we will meet with them again... Annona, Plume, Coleus, and others...",
		"RECORDER_GRAVE_3": "SECCA: I hope so too, Din. It's time for us to go. The voice is calling us...",
		"RECORDER_GRAVE_4": "SECCA: By the way, there's still fuel left in Escall's spacesuit helmet. You can refuel before we leave.",
		"RECORDER_GRAVE_5": "DIN: That's a good idea, thank you.",
		"RECORDER_GRAVE_6": "DIN: If someone ever reads this message in search of us, please exercise caution. After our meal, the voice instructed us to search for the Core, which we believe may be located outside the cave. Therefore, we are heading back in that direction.",

		"TEXT_RIP": "<![CDATA[<b>Here lies the nomai Escall. He was always a true Nomai and remained true to himself until the end.</b>]]>",

		"RECORDER_PRE_ESSENCE_1": "SECCA: D-Din, do you see what I see?",
		"RECORDER_PRE_ESSENCE_2": "DIN:I can confirm. I see it too. We need to collect the Essence. I assume it's inside that node. We don't know what life form it is, but I'd recommend avoiding its tentacles.",
		"RECORDER_PRE_ESSENCE_3": "SECCA:I... I... okay, we can split up to collect it faster. Are you ready?",
		"RECORDER_PRE_ESSENCE_4": "DIN: Y-yes..! We don't know what to expect. We need to allow <![CDATA[<b>our suits to be reused.</b>]]>",
		"RECORDER_PRE_ESSENCE_5": "SECCA: Done. Quick, let's move on!",

		"RECORDER_ESSENCE_1": "SECCA: The voice commanded us to collect it, but the creature's tentacles are dangerous. They cause excruciating pain upon approach!",
		"RECORDER_ESSENCE_2": "SECCA: Din, it was a mistake... we... separated. I'm afraid I can no longer... continue the journey...",
		"RECORDER_ESSENCE_3": "SECCA: ...",

		"RECORDER_ESSENCE_4": "DIN: What is this? I have never seen anything like it... It is beyond our comprehension...",
		"RECORDER_ESSENCE_5": "DIN: It can reappear here at any moment, we need to hur-rr-y...",
		"RECORDER_ESSENCE_6": "DIN: ...",

		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_1": "Heyo hatchling! What's up?",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_2": "What's going on, why you here?",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_3": "What's new, Slate?",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_4": "Good question! We detected a new, strange signal somewhere in the Dark Bramble's orbit.",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_5": "As we know, Dark Bramble has nothing in its orbit. We have detected the signal multiple times, but it keeps disappearing every time we try to take a closer look.",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_6": "Do you have any idea <![CDATA[<color=orange>what could possibly be orbiting Dark Bramble</color>]]>?",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_7": "I might have some ideas. I will fly over and investigate.",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_8": "Perfect. Maybe we will finally find out why it's always disappearing.",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_9": "Bye!",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_10": "Good luck, keep your ship safe.",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_11": "You will never believe me! Dark Bramble becomes BLUE!",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_12": "Wow, this is unbelievable! I have to fly there and uncover all the secrets! <![CDATA[<size=20>]]>Perhaps it's blue because I know the frequency of the signal...<![CDATA[</size>]]>",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_13": "What?",
		"SLATE_DIALOGUE_14": "Ah, nothing! Nevermind. See ya!",


		"NEER_DIALOGUE_1": "We finally met.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_2": "I know you have questions, and I have answers. Ask away.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_3": "Who are you? What is this place?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_4": "Neer? How do I know your name? How are we communicating? Do you understand my language?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_5": "My name is Neer. I am a representative of the Xa'Ri race from the Tri-Star system. I'm likely the last remaining member of our race.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_6": "We are at the origins, where it all began, at the core of our experiment in manipulating space. I assume you can perceive that the experiment did not achieve success...",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_7": "So, Dark Bramble is your doing? Why did you create it?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_8": "It was intended to allow us to control space: to make the small large, to traverse colossal distances in negligible time... But it was all a horrible mistake.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_9": "By imbuing the Bramble, as you call it, with the necessary power, we could barely control it. Our planet, neighboring planets, and who knows how many more planets were destroyed either immediately or gradually.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_10": "I have no idea how far Bramble has spread, but I anticipated that it would happen",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_11": "And now we here...",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_12": "I see...",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_13": "You knew my name all this time. I can sense your consciousness and transmit thoughts and words directly to it, excluding physical contact. I sensed you almost immediately when you came close enough.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_14": "What about the Nomai?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_15": "Their consciousness structure was completely different, but they were likely either depleted or lacked your experience. I'm afraid they couldn't reach this place and perished.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_16": "I saw... they perished at the hands of the creature whose core I entered...",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_17": "That creature is an isolated, personal structural organization of the Bramble. It created it itself and uses it to extract an unknown, dark substance - the essence. It also sensed you, which is why I asked you to collect the essence, so that it could adapt to your presence and allow you inside, here.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_18": "Before we continue... do you have any more questions?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_19": "Who are you? What is this place?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_20": "Neer? How do I know your name? How are we communicating? Do you understand my language?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_21": "Now that you know everything, I'm ready to tell you why we are here and what all of this is for.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_22": "Do you see the structure above? That's <![CDATA[<color=yellow>The Heart</color>]]> - the main mechanism without which the Bramble cannot exist.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_23": "I want to offer you the chance to save dozens, hundreds, even thousands of worlds. Take this <![CDATA[<color=yellow>Heart</color>]]> and return to where you came from. You can do it.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_24": "But it's gigantic! I can't lift it! What about you?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_25": "I have remained here all this time for this moment. I won't be able to leave the Bramble, but you can.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_26": "Fortunately, I still have control over the seeds I personally nurtured. Speaking of the experiments on space, we have achieved some degree of success.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_27": "What do I have to do?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_28": "I will open a portal that, once you enter, will allow you to dispose of <![CDATA[<color=yellow>The Heart</color>]]> once and for all.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_29": "Enter the portal. You will see the difference.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_30": "What will happen afterward?",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_31": "I don't know. <![CDATA[<color=yellow>Heart</color>]]> provides all the capabilities of the Bramble. What it will become without it is a mystery.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_32": "I can speculate that the space inside will start to deform, and the atmosphere will cease to be stable. It will likely be necessary to quickly leave this place. Be prepared.",
		"NEER_DIALOGUE_33": "I'm opening the portal."

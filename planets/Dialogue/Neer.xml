			<Page>It was intended to allow us to control space: to make the small large, to traverse colossal distances in negligible time... But it was all a horrible mistake.</Page>
			<Page>By imbuing the Bramble, as you call it, with the necessary power, we could barely control it. Our planet, neighboring planets, and who knows how many more planets were destroyed either immediately or gradually.</Page>
			<Page> I have no idea how far Bramble has spread, but I anticipated that it would happen.</Page>

			<Page>That creature is an isolated, personal structural organization of the Bramble. It created it itself and uses it to extract an unknown, dark substance - the essence. It also sensed you, which is why I asked you to collect the essence, so that it could adapt to your presence and allow you inside, here.</Page>

		<Text>DIN: That's right. No matter where we go, it always brings us back to the starting point. The only way out is to investigate the node covered in the red substance.</Text>

		<ID>3</ID>
		<Text>SECCA: The substance doesn't look harmless. It's almost like magma, but it's probably not the same material. What if we somehow disrupt the integrity of the membrane?</Text>

		<ID>4</ID>
		<Text>DIN: I've already tried that. Wood, metal, fabric â€” everything instantly ignites.</Text>
